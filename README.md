# Space-Invaders
You have to put images and sound in the same folder with the game file.
Check the game file to see how to name the images and sounds (at the beginning python file).
I plan to upload some images and sound once I find some that are copyright free (or maybe I will create them myself).
Also, some optimization is needed.
